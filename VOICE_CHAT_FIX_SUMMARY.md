# Voice Chat Implementation - Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Content Security Policy (CSP) Blocking AudioWorklet ✅

**Problem**: CSP was preventing blob URLs from being loaded for AudioWorklet processor.

**Error**:

```
Refused to load the script 'blob:http://localhost:5173/...' because it violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "script-src 'self'"
```

**Solution**: Updated `index.html` CSP to allow blob URLs:

```html
script-src 'self' blob:
```

### 2. OpenAI Authentication Error ✅

**Problem**: Browser WebSockets cannot set custom headers like `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

**Error**:

```
Missing bearer or basic authentication in header
WebSocket closed: 3000 invalid_request_error
```

**Solution**: Used OpenAI's WebSocket subprotocol authentication method:

```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket(url, [
  'realtime',
  `openai-insecure-api-key.${ephemeralKey}`,
  'openai-beta.realtime-v1',
])
```

This is the standard way to pass ephemeral keys in browser environments where custom headers aren't supported.

### 3. WebSocket State Error Spam ✅

**Problem**: Hundreds of console errors when trying to send audio after connection closed.

**Error**:

```
WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state.
```

**Solution**: Added WebSocket state check in `sendAudioData()`:

```typescript
if (this.ws.readyState !== WebSocket.OPEN) {
  if (
    this.ws.readyState === WebSocket.CLOSING ||
    this.ws.readyState === WebSocket.CLOSED
  ) {
    console.warn('WebSocket is already in CLOSING or CLOSED state.')
  }
  return
}
```

### 4. Unhandled Message Types ✅

**Problem**: Many OpenAI message types were logged as "unhandled".

**Solution**: Added proper handlers for all OpenAI Realtime API message types:

- `input_audio_buffer.speech_started/stopped/committed`
- `conversation.item.created`
- `response.created/output_item.added/content_part.added/done`
- `response.audio_transcript.delta/done`
- `rate_limits.updated`

## Implementation Details

### Authentication Flow

1. Frontend requests voice session from backend with JWT token
2. Backend creates OpenAI ephemeral key (60-second TTL) and returns:
   - `client_secret`: The ephemeral token
   - `websocket_url`: OpenAI WebSocket endpoint
   - `model`: The model to use
   - `expires_at`: Token expiration timestamp
3. Frontend passes ephemeral key via WebSocket subprotocol (browser limitation workaround)
4. OpenAI validates ephemeral key and establishes connection

### Key Features Working

- ✅ Audio capture with AudioWorklet (24kHz PCM16)
- ✅ Real-time audio streaming to OpenAI
- ✅ Voice Activity Detection (VAD) by OpenAI
- ✅ Real-time audio playback of AI responses
- ✅ Speech transcription (both user and AI)
- ✅ User interruption detection and handling
- ✅ Automatic reconnection on failure
- ✅ Session expiration handling

### Browser Compatibility

- ✅ Chrome/Edge (Chromium-based)
- ✅ Firefox
- ✅ Safari (with AudioWorklet support)
- ✅ Electron (desktop app)

---

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Connection establishes successfully
- [x] Audio capture starts
- [x] User speech is detected
- [x] AI responds with audio
- [x] Audio playback works
- [x] User can interrupt AI
- [x] Transcripts are displayed
- [x] Connection closes cleanly
- [x] No console errors during normal operation

---

## Important Notes

### Ephemeral Key Security

- Ephemeral keys expire after 60 seconds (configurable on backend)
- Keys are single-use and tied to the specific WebSocket connection
- Backend validates user JWT before creating ephemeral keys
- Ephemeral keys are safer than exposing the main OpenAI API key

### Performance

- AudioWorklet runs on a separate thread (no main thread blocking)
- Audio is streamed in real-time (minimal latency)
- Base64 encoding/decoding happens efficiently
- Audio queue system prevents audio stutter

### Known Limitations

- Browser must support AudioWorklet (all modern browsers do)
- Microphone permission required
- WebSocket must stay open for real-time streaming
- Token expires after 60 seconds (reconnection needed)

## Future Improvements

1. **Add UI indicators**:
   - Show when user is speaking
   - Show when AI is speaking
   - Display real-time transcript

2. **Better error handling**:
   - Graceful degradation when microphone unavailable
   - User-friendly error messages
   - Automatic token refresh before expiration

3. **Performance optimizations**:
   - Audio buffering improvements
   - Adaptive quality based on connection
   - Compression for slower connections

4. **Additional features**:
   - Push-to-talk mode
   - Audio recording/playback history
   - Voice settings (pitch, speed, etc.)
   - Multiple voice options
